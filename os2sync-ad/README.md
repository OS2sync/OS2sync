This project is based on the STSOrgSync-2-AD codebase build by DSD, and originally released here

https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/4534202

This codebase is migrated to .NET Core 2.2, and uses the OS2sync library instead of STSOrgSync, but keeps mostly the
same functionality, though with respect to the changes found in OS2sync, and the technical changes due to the
migration to .NET Core
